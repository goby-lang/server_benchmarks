# Server benchmarks

## Apps

This repo is to store some very simple web apps for us to easily run benchmarks on them.

These apps will have similar logic:

- Render "Hello World"
- Set header `Content-Type` to `text/html`

## How to start apps
For now we have following apps:
- `puma_test`: A simple rack app run by puma, just run `puma -C puma_test/puma.rb`. This will run on 0.0.0.0:8080 by default.
- `goby_simple_server`: A goby app uses built in simple server. Run `goby goby_simpler_server.gb` should work. This runs on localhost:3000 by default.

## Script

I use `Apache bench` (`ab`) to do the benchmark, with flags `-n 10000 -c 100`
